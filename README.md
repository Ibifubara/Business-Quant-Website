# Business Quant website built with **HTML, CSS AND JavaScript** based on a **Figma design**
This project was my first experience working with a Figma design file. I used it to practice translating a design into a real, responsive website while ensuring it remained true to the original concept.

## Features
- **Pixel-perfect implementation** - Followed the figma design closely
- **Responsive design** - Created mobile and tablet layouts since only a desktop version was provided.  
- **Style Guide Adherence** – Maintained consistency with colors, typography, and spacing.  
- **Interactive Elements** – Used JavaScript to enhance user experience.
